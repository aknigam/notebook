The following diagram show the key internal components of a typical JVM that conforms to The Java Virtual Machine Specification Java SE 7 Edition.  The components shown on this diagram are each explained below in two sections. First section covers the components that are created for each thread and the second section covers the components that are created independently of threads.

What is the Go standard library and why is it important? The Go standard library is a set of core packages that enhance and extend the language. These packages add to the number of different types of programs you can write without the need to build your own packages or download packages others have published. Since these packages are tied to the language, they come with some special guarantees:

I am doing some tests to understand the behaviour of @Transactional in Spring 3. Though, it is not working as I would expect. If have one method with Propagation.REQUIRED calling another with Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW, will the second method be able to retrieve from the DB the data inserted by the first method?

A thread is a thread of execution in a program. The JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently. In the Hotspot JVM there is a direct mapping between a Java Thread and a native operating system Thread. After preparing all of the state for a Java thread such as thread-local storage, allocation buffers, synchronization objects, stacks and the program counter, the native thread is created. The native thread is reclaimed once the Java thread terminates. The operating system is therefore responsible for scheduling all threads and dispatching them to any available CPU. Once the native thread has initialized it invokes the
